accidents_recode <-accidents %>%

                       `Saturday` = "Weekend",
                       `Sunday` = "Weekend"))
ggplot(accidents_recode, aes(x = time, 
                  fill = severity)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1, 
               alpha = 0.5
               ) +
    theme_minimal()+
 facet_wrap(~week,
            nrow =2) +
  labs(
    x = "Time of day",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Number of accidents throughout the day", 
    subtitle = "By day of week and severity",
    fill = "Severity",
  )
